# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1. We can create a private subnet and move the web application instance to that subnet.
2. Then create a NAT gateway in the public subnet and route the traffic from the private subnet to the NAT gateway.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, the VPC private endpoints for S3 will only prevent the access to the S3 bucket from the internet. It will not prevent the access from within the VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, it will only encrypt the data that is uploaded after the encryption setting is applied.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Since I made changes on the services without renaming them, this modifications could be overwritten, and eventually causing the initial security vulnerabilities to reappear.
