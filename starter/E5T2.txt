# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

* Regula

### Example vulnerability
// Terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"  # Vulnerability: S3 bucket is public-read
}

In some situations when a S3 bucket allows plublic acess it can be a vulnerability

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

*  Amazon ECR image scanning

### Example vulnerability

// Dockerfile
```FROM node:14

# Install packages with known vulnerabilities
RUN npm install vulnerable-package@1.0.```

ECR image scanning may identify the vulnerable package during the scanning process

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

* AWS Config
### Example vulnerability
An example of a vulnerability that AWS Config can identify is also an S3 bucket that allows public access
