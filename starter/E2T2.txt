# Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
## Vulnerabilities collected per vector
Access to Cloud Services
* MFA should be enabled for the root user
* (MFA) is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users that use a console password.
* IAM root user access key should not exist
* Ensure IAM password policy requires minimum password length of 14 or greater
* No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-0ca7a5e076c163479 in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts.
* Instance i-0ca7a5e076c163479 is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
* IAM user credentials unused for 45 days should be removed
* MFA should be enabled for all IAM users that have a console password

Access to Cloud Infrastructure
* VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
* Network ACLs should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 or port 3389
* VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
* S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled
* S3 general purpose buckets should have MFA delete enabled
* Instance i-0ca7a5e076c163479 is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.

Defensive Securitry in the Cloud (Monitoring and Alerting)
* CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events

Protecting Data Stored in the Cloud
* EBS default encryption should be enabled
* S3 buckets should require requests to use SSL






# Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
## Recommendations for remediation

Access to Cloud Services
* Setup MFAs
* Avoid Api keys for IAM users
* Setup IAM password policy

Access to Cloud Infrastructure
* Controlling Network Traffic (Ingress and Egress)
  * Proxy all traffic through a NAT gateway (?)
  * Configure NACLs to allow only necessary traffic to and from the trusted subnets
  * Configure security groups to allow only necessary traffic to and from the EC2 instances
Protecting Data Stored in the Cloud
* Enable S3 encryption for all S3 buckets
* Use Object Versioning
* Block Public Access
* Use VPC Endpoints to block requests that not coming from the trusted VPC network.
* Use S3 Bucket Policies to restrict control access
